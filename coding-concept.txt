each have 5 cards (radomized from a deck of 52)

cards are randomly dealt to an array for each player

player 1 checks their cards for pairs, auto eliminated
player 1 checks their cards for pairs, auto eliminated
note: pair is determined by num/val not the suit

cards are removed from the array and updated

player 1 has x cards left in array
player 2 has x cards left in array

player 1 goes first and requests a card in their hand needed for a pair
- if player 2 array does not contain, player 1 takes card random from deck and adds to their hand
- if there is a match, card removes from player 2, and from player 1 hand arrays.
count of pairs +1 for player 1
